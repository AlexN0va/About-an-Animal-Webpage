    <h2>Shoebill Behavior</h2>
    <p>
            The Shoebill is known for its slow dull movements, and its tendency to stay still for long periods of time. They are quite senstive to human interaction, though they are often descriubes as "statue-like". These large birds perch on floating vegetation looking for food. The Shoebill is very solitary. Their huntign is slow and often seems motionless. When the Shoebill finds prey they make a quick voilent strike.

    <h2>Breeding</h2>
    <p>
      The Shoebill has a solitary nature and that also extends to its breeding habits. Nests tend to be in colonies and groups, and the breeding pair vigorously defends their territory. The Shoebill pair creates a large flat nesting platform partially submerged in water. The nests are made from aquatic vegitation, often prepared after the wet seasons. one to three egss are layed at a time. These incubation tend to last for around 30 days and that is when the Shoebill pairs, mainly female, actively guard their nests. Mandibles are used to coll their eggs. Once there is hatchlings they are given food through the bill of the hatchling. It takes 3 years for hatchlings to become fully sexually mature.

    <h2>Flight Pattern</h2>
    <p>
      As the Shoebill soars through the sky its wings are held flat. Similar to Pelicans the Shoebill flies with its neck retracted. The Sheobill has the slowest amounts of flaps per minute in flight, 150 flaps per minute. The Shoebill does alternating flapping and glides through the air at most times. Their flights tend to range from 100 to 500 m up, and long flights in these birds are rare.
