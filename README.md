#### About
Through my love for the ominous Shoebill bird, I created a website surrounded by its characteristics. After doing research I also gave information on what this bird looks like, sounds like, where it lives, its behaviors, and other attributes. I wanted to keep my website simple, but also show that I understood the bird through a bit of an ominous look to the website. I used a lot of the colors the bird consists of making it seem more connected to the bird. Through proper consideration for every kind of person on the web, I tried to diversify my code and make it accessible to the best of my abilities.
